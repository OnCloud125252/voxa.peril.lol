The code may undergo significant changes, and some features may be incomplete or break between versions. Use at your own risk and report any issues you find!\r\n\r\n## ✨ Highlights of This Release\r\n\r\n- **🧹 Memory Leak Prevention**\r\n  - Added a *weak* reference to `WKWebView` in the `Coordinator`, preventing strong reference cycles.\r\n  - Removed the `channelClick` message handler in `deinit` to avoid lingering references within `WKUserContentController`.\r\n- **🏗️ Code Quality Enhancements**\r\n  - Centralized window-positioning logic and added checks for missing screens to prevent potential errors.\r\n  - Provided a fallback HTML page when invalid URLs are encountered, improving user experience.\r\n  - Introduced minor logging hooks in SwiftUI’s `.onAppear` and `.onDisappear` to simplify debugging.\r\n- **🔧 UI & Debugging Improvements**\r\n  - Applied subtle logging for better insight into the SwiftUI lifecycle.\r\n\r\n## 📜 Full Changelog\r\n\r\nFor a detailed list of commits, please visit the [commit history](https://github.com/plyght/Voxa/commits/?since=2024-12-01&until=2025-01-05).\r\n\r\n> **📝 Note**  \r\n> We acknowledge that this release may not be fully polished or documented.
